# Hi there, I'm Basireddy Jaya Sankar Reddy 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I am a specialized Developer with a core focus on **Game Programming** and **High-Performance Backend Systems**. Currently, I am deep-diving into **Game Engine Development using C#**, building tools from the ground up to understand the physics and rendering pipelines that power modern gaming.

Beyond the engine, I have extensive experience in **AI-driven automation**, **Quantum Security**, and **Scalable Backend Services**. I thrive on complex logic and detailed system architecture.

- 🎮 **Current Mission:** Developing a custom Game Engine in C#.
- 🛠️ **Major Interests:** Game Physics, Graphics Programming, and Backend Architecture.
- ⚡ **Technical Philosophy:** Precision in logic, depth in detail.

## 🛠 Technical Deep-Dive: C# Game Engine Development

Building a game engine from scratch requires a deep understanding of the software lifecycle and hardware interaction. My current development focus includes:

* **Architecture:** Implementing a component-based architecture (ECS) to decouple data from logic, ensuring high performance as the object count scales.
* **Rendering Pipeline:** Working with graphics APIs to manage the lifecycle of a frame—from clearing buffers to draw calls and swap chains.
* **Physics & Math:** Developing custom 2D/3D math libraries (Vectors, Matrices, Quaternions) to handle spatial transformations and collision detection without relying on heavy external black-box libraries.
* **Memory Management:** Optimizing the garbage collector in C# to prevent "stutter" in high-performance loops, focusing on object pooling and minimizing heap allocations.
